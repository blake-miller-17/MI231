# MI231
Game and Interactive Media Development course at MSU

# NOTE! 
The webGL versions of these do not currently work so the entire projects are included in the folders
They run in Unity as of now and I am working to figure out the webGL issues so that the games are 
playable from the web.

**p.s.** The old builds only worked well with Firefox, so hopefully the new ones work on all browsers.
