___What are the controls to your game? How do we play?___
The controls to the game are either the W,A,S,D or the arrow keys. You can attack
by pressing the Z key. It plays as a 2D game where everything is on one axis of 
movement. So far there is only one room where you cannot leave from. You can move around
the level and open doors as well as take damage from the skeletos as well.
